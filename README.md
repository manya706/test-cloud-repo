## Cloud Infrastructure and Services Lab-8.

Create two EC2 Linux instances in two different regions for Developer A and Developer B, respectively. Developer A installs git in his system, creates a directory, writes contents in the working area, moves the contents to the staging area, and commits in the local repository. The local repository can be added to a central repository, and the contents can be pushed to the central repository. Developer B will also do the same as Developer A. The developers can pull the contents of the central repository and find the updated contents along with the respective changes made by the developers.
